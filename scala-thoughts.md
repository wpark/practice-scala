  - What's easy to do in Scala? What's not?
  Just like Haskell, It's easy to do Pattern Matching in Scala.
  However, I find it very hard to get familiar with the concept of "options", especially "Some". Also, I find it a little inconvenient that unlike in 
  langauges like Python, user has to define types of all parameters and outputs
  when creating a function in Scala.

  Additionally, I really liked that there were so many built-in functions that
  operate on lists and most of them are very intuitive and simple. On this note,
  I also really appreciated that Scala, just like Haskell, has the "head" and 
  "last" built-in functions that operate on sequences. 

  - What is/are your favorite language design choice(s) that the designers of 
  Scala made? Why?
  I am not sure if this is part of the "design", but I strongly felt that Scala
  offers very kind and informative error messages. Examples would be Scala 
  throwing an error saying that a function used is not a member of a type that 
  the function is called on to.


  - What is/are your least favorite language design choice(s)? Why? And why do
  you think the designers made that / those choice(s)?
  I noticed that unlike in Python, you can't really execute a "script", but 
  instead have to do everything within objects in Scala. It shouldn't make a 
  huge difference, but I still find this inconvenient.  


  - What Scala features would you like to learn more about?
  foldLeft, foldRight, more on Options, for and foreach, and so on.
