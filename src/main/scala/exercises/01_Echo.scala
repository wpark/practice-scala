   * DETAILS ABOUT FUNCTION / METHOD DEFINITIONS
   * ---------------------------------
   * Function definitions in Scala are different from many other languages. The
   * syntax looks a little bit like Python or Haskell, and the behavior is more
   * like Racket or Haskell.
   * 
   * In particular, Scala programmers don't use `return`. Instead, the result
   * of a function is the last expression in that function (just like Racket
   * or Haskell).
   * 
   * For more information on functions, see:
   * 		Scala for the Impatient, 2/e chapters 2.7â€“2.10
   */
  
  /**
   * This function's result should be the same as its argument. For example,
   * `echo("hi")` should be "hi".
   * 
   * This exercise is taken from ScalaLabs:
