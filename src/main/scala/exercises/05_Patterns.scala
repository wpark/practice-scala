/**
 * These exercises introduce you to Scala's powerful pattern matching features.
 *
 * Pattern matching can in its essence be compared to Java's 'switch' statement,
 * even though it provides many more possibilities. Whereas the Java switch statement
 * lets you 'match' primitive types up to int's, Scala's pattern matching goes much
 * further. Practically everything from all types of objects and Collections
 * can be matched, not forgetting xml and a special type of class called case classes.
 *
 * Pattern matching is also often used in combination with recursive algorithms.
 *
 * For this exercise exclusively use pattern matching constructs in order to make the
 * corresponding test work.
 * 
 * For more information on pattern matching, see:
 * 		http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/pattern-matching.html
 * 	AND / OR
 * 		Scala for the Impatient, 2/e Sections 14.1â€“14.5
 * 
 * These exercises are taken from ScalaLabs:

 * DETAILS ABOUT case classES
 * ---------------------------------
 * A case class is a nice way to declare a class whose main purpose is to
 * hold data.
 * 
 * We won't need to know too much about case classes (yet), but here is some
 * information on how they're used:
 * 
 * val person = Person('Ashley', 42)   // create a `Person` object
 * println(person.name)							   // print the `Person`'s name
 *
